## Github Stats

Github stats are a card that show your overall Github status.

`![userName's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=userName&show_icons=true&theme=yourTheme)`

Just change the `userName` slots with your Github username and `yourTheme` with the following themes available in Github:
- [x] cobalt = `&theme=cobalt`
- [x] synthwave = `&theme=synthwave`
- [x] tokyonight = `&theme=tokyonight`
- [x] onedark = `&theme=onedark`
- [x] gruvbox = `&theme=gruvbox`
- [x] merko = `&theme=merko`
- [x] radical = `&theme=radical`
- [x] dark = `&theme=dark`
- [x] highcontrast = `&theme=highcontrast`
- [x] dracula = `&theme=dracula`
###### Again, these are just _default_ themes available in Github

#

## Top Languages Card

The Top Langs card is a card which shows your top 5, most-used languages.

`![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=userName&layout=compact&theme=yourTheme)`

Like for the Stats card change the `userName` slots with your Github username and `yourTheme` with the Github-friendly themes from the [stats section](https://github.com/PluginPenguin/Build-a-Better-README#github-stats)

#

## Profile Views

This card is small, displaying the amount of times your Github profile has been viewed.

###### One downfall to this is that if you view your own profile, it counts that 1 more view.

`![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=userName)`

Like always, change `userName` to your Github username.

###### I recommend added this last.

#

## Special Pins

These are like highlighted repos.

Change `userName` to your Github username, change `repoName` to the repo of your choosing, and `repoLink` to the link of the repository you want to pin.

Input this formula to pin any Github repo:

`[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=userName&repo=repoName)](https://github.com/userName/repoLink)`

# That's it!
