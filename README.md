## Github Stats

Github stats are a card that show your overall Github status.

`![userName's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=userName&show_icons=true&theme=yourTheme)`

Just change the `userName` slots with your Github username and `yourTheme` with the following themes available in Github:
- [x] cobalt = `&theme=cobalt` (my favourite - this theme is in my README)
- [x] synthwave = `&theme=synthwave`
- [x] tokyonight = `&theme=tokyonight`
- [x] onedark = `&theme=onedark`
- [x] gruvbox = `&theme=gruvbox`
- [x] merko = `&theme=merko`
- [x] radical = `&theme=radical`
- [x] dark = `&theme=dark`
- [x] highcontrast = `&theme=highcontrast`
- [x] dracula = `&theme=dracula`
###### Again, these are just _default_ themes available in Github

## Top Languages Card

The Top Langs card is a card which shows your top 5, most-used languages.

`![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=userName&layout=compact&theme=yourTheme)`

Like for the Stats card change the `userName` slots with your Github username and `yourTheme` with the Github-friendly themes from the [stats section]("")
